Welcome to EXLIME botic game! 
This is a game trying to mimic some features of slime mold. We want to build up a community by opening our project to everyone so that the project can keep developing. 
The first idea came from an activity in X-institute; the first demo was created over 3 days; each team member played a role to contribute and learned a lot as the new.
We hope everyone can find their answers to the question, which is "How can we do research by playing games".
Enjoy and have fun!
