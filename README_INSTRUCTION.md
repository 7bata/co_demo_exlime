How to use the project:
1. download zip of main
2. unzip and copy all files in the unzipped folder
3. create a new unity project in the unity hub(if you do not have a unity hub, you need to search some instructions, which is really simple)
4. find the location of the new project
5. paste all the copied files and replace(if your computers require) all the files in the folder of the new project
6. open the updated project in the unity hub
if the project is empty when you open it, you need to find a folder called Scenes in the project in unity, and double-click the file called oldscene.
if still it doesn't work, try to do these steps again, or you can leave a message to me
